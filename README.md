# About
This repository documents my progress going through the book [Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf).

# Environment
You can use the [DrRacket IDE](https://download.racket-lang.org/) to run the code or install the runtime via your relevant distribution.
Ensure you have the *sicp* package by following [this](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/Installation.html) or running in the terminal:
```raco pkg install sicp```
